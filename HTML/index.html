    <p><h2><a id = "dj1"></a>David Guetta</h2>
        From: Paris, France
        Best known for: Breaking dance music in America with a string of huge hits.
        Fave tune of 2020: “CamelPhat & ARTBAT 'For A Feeling’.”
        Rising star DJ/producer of 2020: “I'm a huge fan of ARTBAT and I think they can become even bigger than they already are.”
        What’s the greatest dance record of all time? “The best dance album ever is ‘Homework' from Daft Punk. I don’t think it will ever be challenged.”

        “It’s really incredible, I think I feel happier than the first time!”

        David Guetta is sat on a comfy sofa in an airy East London photography studio. He’s been having his photo taken by DJ Mag’s cover specialist Dan Reid for the last three hours, dressed in a variety of outfits, and has remained chipper and super-positive throughout the afternoon.

        We’re here because David has been voted the No.1 DJ in the world again — a full decade after he last won the title in 2011. The only other time he won, Guetta said that winning the Top 100 DJs poll meant more to him than having a No.1 hit record in America. And evidently, winning it a second time means even more to him than that. “It’s interesting, cos it’s a different time,” he says. “Things are way faster now. When I won ten years ago, the reality was that I felt like it came late. The reality of the numbers when I was touring, it was already like two years where I felt, ‘Why am I not winning?’, y’know?”

        This isn’t just an idle brag from the healthy-looking, self-aware Frenchman. In late 2011 he was the biggest dance star on the planet, having broken down the doors of mainstream America with a string of global dance-pop hits following in the wake of ‘When Love Takes Over’, which featured ex-Destiny’s Child vocalist Kelly Rowland. “When I won the first time, I was like ‘OK, if I go to Google search and my name is ten times higher, it should have happened’,” he tells DJ Mag. “It’s funny because ten years ago when I won, all the trance fans were so mad against me because it was the first time that trance wasn’t winning — for years. It was the beginning of that EDM era in the festivals.”

        Younger readers may not remember that the Top 100 DJs poll was dominated by trance spinners throughout the ‘00s. After three victories for Tiësto (when he played trance) and two for Paul van Dyk, Armin van Buuren won four times in a row (2007-10) until Guetta claimed the crown in 2011. The Top 100 DJs awards party that year was held in Amsterdam during ADE for the first time, and a partisan Dutch crowd of Armin fans booed Guetta when he was revealed as the new No.1. “Armin is my friend, he was feeling really bad about that,” smiles Guetta at the memory.

        Guetta’s first Top 100 win a decade ago did signal EDM — basically the rebranding of drop-heavy electro-house for the US market — taking over from trance and dominating the 21st century’s second decade. Guetta spearheaded a slew of dance tracks penetrating the mainstream American market, and the subsequent global explosion of electronic music gave untold people a viable career in the industry at long last. “Yeah, this is why some people were hating me!” David exclaims. “It’s funny, I was public enemy No.1 for doing this — for being successful — and also for working with people who were part of the urban community. It then became what every successful DJ/producer is doing now, completely acceptable, but I think the younger generation doesn’t even realise that when I started to do this, people were mad at me for doing this.”

        Who wouldn’t want to work with Rihanna, asks DJ Mag? “Why are you not gonna want to work with a talented person? To me, it doesn’t make sense,” David concurs. “Those reactions were more coming from fans than the artists because actually all the big DJs at the time — including the American pioneers — were coming to me and saying, ‘Oh my god, I’ve been dreaming all my life to do this, how did you do this? This is crazy’. 

        “It’s interesting to see that the first time that I won [the Top 100 DJs poll] it was for making our music cross over into the mainstream, and for me, it was also the fight to have our culture more recognised,” he continues. “I was always feeling strongly about the quality of our music, and thinking ‘Why are we not as big as hip-hop or rock or pop? Why is the music industry looking down on us?’ I think all those hits — ‘I Got A Feeling’, ‘Sexy Bitch’, ‘When Love Takes Over’, ‘Memories’, all those records that became global No.1s — made our scene more respected in the music industry. And also everybody got more money!”

    <p><h2><a id = "dj2"></a>Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike</h2>
        Style: 
        “Our style has always been about the crowd.”
        Best known for: 
        “Smashin’ the house.”
        Tune of the year: 
        “‘Tricks’ by Bassjackers.”
        Though they’ve been unable to tour as normal, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike still managed to stay in touch with their fans this year via social media. Releasing a plethora of singles, perhaps the most notable was ‘Do It!’, a collaboration with Belgian producer Azteck and Mexican singer/influencer Kimberly Loaiza. It had a staggering 50 million views within 24 hours on TikTok, and the #DoIt dance video trended in Latin America and the US, encouraging fans to submit their own dance challenge videos to the platform. In addition, the brothers released more club-geared tracks such as ‘The Anthem’ with Timmy Trumpet and ‘Clap Your Hands’ with Fedde Le Grand and W&W, while their single ‘Instagram’ reached 200 million streams on Spotify.
        Mike focused on his new label Green Room, which allows him to work on solo projects and also shine a light on upcoming artists.
        “I’ve been releasing solo tracks for close to two years now, and once I started working on my album project, it felt like the right time to launch my own label,” he says. “I officially launched the label with ‘High Off Love’ at the start of 2020, just before all this COVID-19 chaos, and we’ve been up and rolling ever since. One way that lockdown has been good for me is getting more time to restructure the label, so I can give other artists the platform to bounce from. We dropped an EP back in June featuring D-Wayne, 13 NIGHT, JPK, Asonn, T.I.M, LENN, Mackum Jaime Deraz, and more are coming. My own latest single on Green Room is ‘Excited’ with C Natty.”
        Tomorrowland festival residents, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike played the first virtual edition in July, Tomorrowland Around The World. Though they were initially unsure how the event would work, it proved to be a resounding success. “After so long away from the festival vibe, it was incredible to be involved in this enormous two-day digital experience bringing all the people of Tomorrowland together,” they say. “It was a first in dance music, and many probably thought it was not going to work like a real show, but the desire for it from the fans – and artists – was insane! Over one million people tuned in and shared this global experience. It was a new chapter in the history book, of not just Tomorrowland, but the dance scene. We came together to make something magical happen, and it was so amazing to be a part of it.”
        Dimitri continued to expand his acting CV after appearances in recent Men In Black and Rambo movies, with probably his most high profile role yet. “I’ve been cast in the upcoming Jurassic World: Dominion, the third part of the new Jurassic World trilogy,” he says. “It’s been an amazing experience and a childhood dream come true to be part of something I was fascinated with when I was a child. There’re various other movie projects underway, and without disclosing too much, the timing of having so much ‘free’ time works out perfectly with all the new movie stuff coming up, so I’ll be spending a lot of time on film sets in the next months.”

    <p><h2><a id = "dj3"></a>Martin Garrix</h2>
        Style: 
        “Electronic/pop music.”
        Best known for: 
        “Three times No.1 on the DJ Mag Top 100. ‘Summer Days’, ‘In The Name Of Love’, ‘Scared To Be Lonely’, ‘Drown’, ‘Animals’. Official music artist of EURO2020.”
        Tune of the year: 
        “Loopers feat. Iyona ‘Fire & Rain’.”
        Martin Garrix continues an incredible run of form in the Top 100 DJs poll, with his No.3 spot marking the seventh year that he’s maintained in the top five — having been top three for the past five years — since first entering the chart in 2013. Following last year’s results, the 24-year-old Dutchman was announced as the official music artist of EURO2020, following in the footsteps of David Guetta, who delivered the official music for EURO2016. In March, in the closing episode of season four of The Martin Garrix Show, Garrix was shown working alongside composer and pianist Giorgio Tuinfort as a symphony recorded the music they wrote together for the tournament. It would, unfortunately, be delayed until June 2021 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it demonstrates the incredible heights the young Dutchman continues to push in his career.
        In June, Garrix also revealed his newly refurbished STMPD studio complex. The new facility, which has been under refurbishment for the past three years, has already welcomed the likes of Young Thug, Big Sean, and One Republic. The new complex has a 360-degree approach, with music, film and advertising all catered for across multiple studios, making it what he describes as “the most advanced studio complex in The Netherlands”.
        Despite the coronavirus pandemic putting a stopper to live shows across the world, fans have still been able to access some big performances from Garrix, with him playing a set from the rooftop of the A’Dam Tower for the 2020 King’s Day celebrations, and Tomorrowland’s digital festival. “I loved playing the sets even though it was very different without an audience, of course,” he tells DJ Mag. “It at least gave me the feeling of being on stage again. I really miss that.”
        Speaking about what he’s been doing during lockdown, Garrix explains that he’s “been making loads and loads of new music”, and it’s clear he’s managed to maintain creativity, with ‘Fire’ featuring Elderbrook, ‘Higher Ground’ and ‘Drown’ all landing this year. “The only upside of this is that I’ve got to spend so much time in the studio,” he tells DJ Mag about the COVID-19 lockdown. “But I do have to say that I miss being able to be together in the studio with artists I collaborate with. For example, ‘Fire’ with Elderbrook was made almost completely via WhatsApp and FaceTime. I absolutely loved working with him and I love the end result, but I wish we could have experienced that magical studio moment together.”
        Garrix also says that the break from touring has afforded him some much-needed down-time, including the chance to spend a lot of time windsurfing. “It has helped me to wind down,” he explains. “I’ve had my first actual holiday in years and being on the water helps me to shut off my thoughts and only focus on one thing.” 
        Looking to the future, Garrix says he has some very exciting projects in the pipeline that he can’t reveal the details of yet, but adds that he feels like he’s been “making some of the best music I’ve ever made the last couple of months. It’s coming your way soon!”
        What three things have most helped you through coronavirus lockdown?

        “Friends, family and music.”
        What lessons should the industry learn from this crisis?
        “I think lots of organisations and artists have shown their creativity in the past couple of months, which is amazing. Also for me, I’ve learned that sometimes it’s good to hit the pause button and take some time off.”
        What steps need to be taken to address the racism in the dance music scene?
        “It’s very important to continue addressing these issues. Keep the conversation going.”
        What industry changes are you personally pushing for to make the dance music scene more inclusive?
        “I always treat people around me the way I want to be treated myself. With STMPD RCRDS we’re really trying to showcase a diverse array of artists, no matter what genre, background etc. Same goes for the people I work with. However, I do think this is definitely something we need to keep working on and can improve to hopefully lead by example in the future.”
        What’s the greatest dance music track of all time?
        “There are so many great ones, so that’s very hard, but ‘Levels’ by Avicii is still one of my favourites of all time.”
